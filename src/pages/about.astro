    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Show Me Resistance was born out of frustration — and hope. We believe
      every Missourian deserves to understand what’s happening in their
      government without needing a law degree or lobbyist access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to make Missouri politics plain, bold, and impossible to
      ignore — especially for progressives in rural or red regions who often
      feel outnumbered and unheard.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expose harmful legislation and political hypocrisy</li>
      <li>Track votes and hold elected officials accountable</li>
      <li>Follow the money behind Missouri politics</li>
      <li>Provide tools to help you show up and speak out</li>
      <li>Amplify voices of resistance from outside city strongholds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: No more legal jargon. Just the facts, plain and bold.</li>
      <li><strong>Defiance</strong>: We don’t sugarcoat — we speak truth to power.</li>
      <li><strong>Truth</strong>: Backed by receipts, not spin.</li>
      <li><strong>Action</strong>: Because awareness means nothing without movement.</li>
    </ul>
